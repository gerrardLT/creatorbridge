## Project Name
CreatorBridge

## Tagline
The Programmable IP Layer for the Agentic Economy

## Short Description
CreatorBridge is the first Agent-Native IP Marketplace built on Story Protocol, transforming static digital assets into programmable liquidity with automated royalty distribution and on-chain derivative tracking.

## Long Description

CreatorBridge revolutionizes intellectual property management by bringing programmable licensing to the masses. Built on Story Protocol's specialized blockchain infrastructure, we enable creators to protect, monetize, and share their digital works with unprecedented ease and automation.

Traditional IP protection is expensive, slow, and inaccessible to independent creators. Copyright registration costs hundreds of dollars and takes months. Licensing requires lawyers, contracts, and manual tracking systems. When your work is remixed or goes viral, collecting royalties is nearly impossible.

CreatorBridge solves these problems with three core innovations:

**1. One-Click IP Registration**
Upload your work and register it on Story Protocol blockchain in seconds. Immutable, timestamped proof of ownership without legal fees or paperwork.

**2. Programmable IP Licenses**
Choose from three license types with machine-readable terms:
- Non-Commercial: Free sharing with attribution
- Commercial Use: Upfront licensing fees
- Commercial Remix: Allow derivatives while automatically collecting 0-100% revenue share

**3. Automated Royalty Distribution**
Smart contracts handle instant revenue splits. No invoices, no chasing payments, no 30% platform fees. Pure automated royalty streams that scale with your cultural impact.

## Key Features

- Zero-Knowledge Wallet: Login with Face ID, Touch ID, or Windows Hello via Coinbase Smart Wallet
- AI Content Generation: Built-in AI image generation for rapid prototyping
- Multi-Format Support: Images, audio, video, and documents
- License Templates: Save and reuse custom licensing configurations
- Derivative Registry: On-chain relationship graphs track remixes and attribution
- Real-Time Analytics: Live dashboard showing earnings from licenses and derivatives
- Transparent Lineage: Visual IP family trees showing derivative relationships

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Blockchain: Story Protocol (Aeneid Testnet)
- Smart Contracts: Story Protocol SDK v1.4.2
- Database: Prisma + PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Wallet: Coinbase Smart Wallet SDK
- Indexer: Goldsky Subgraph
- Testing: Jest with property-based testing (fast-check)

## Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
- Independent digital artists and illustrators
- Music producers and composers
- AI content creators
- Graphic designers and photographers
- Content creators seeking IP protection

**Secondary Users:**
- Brands managing digital assets
- Developers building AI agents that need to license content
- Legal teams exploring blockchain-based IP rights
- Investors interested in IP-backed assets

## Problem Statement

The global IP licensing market is worth $320 billion annually, yet less than 1% of digital creators participate. Why?

1. **Ownership Crisis**: Proving you created something online is expensive and slow. Traditional copyright costs hundreds and takes months.

2. **Monetization Gap**: Licensing requires lawyers, contracts, and tracking systems. Independent creators can't afford this infrastructure.

3. **Derivative Works**: In remix culture, derivatives are everywhere. Creators have zero control and zero revenue share from downstream uses.

The current system serves corporations, not creators. We're changing that.

## Our Solution

CreatorBridge provides enterprise-grade IP infrastructure to individual creators:

**Instant Registration**
- Register IP assets in seconds, not months
- Cost: Pennies in gas fees vs. hundreds in legal costs
- Immutable blockchain proof of ownership

**Programmable Licensing**
- Machine-readable terms for autonomous agent discovery
- Three PIL (Programmable IP License) flavors
- Customizable minting fees and revenue share percentages

**Automated Enforcement**
- Smart contracts execute royalty splits automatically
- On-chain derivative tracking with transparent attribution
- Real-time settlement (0.2s latency)

**Agent-Native Design**
- API-first architecture for AI agent integration
- No UI required for license negotiation and purchase
- Built for the future of autonomous economic actors

## Business Model

**Current (MVP):**
- Free to use during testnet phase
- Building user base and gathering feedback
- Proving product-market fit

**Future Revenue Streams:**
1. Platform Fee: 2.5% on license sales and derivative royalties
2. Premium Features: Advanced analytics, batch operations, white-label solutions
3. Enterprise Licensing: Custom deployments for brands and platforms
4. API Access: Metered usage for AI agents and integrations

## Market Opportunity

- Global IP licensing market: $320 billion annually
- 50+ million independent artists on DeviantArt, ArtStation, Behance

## Team (Hackathon Context)

This project was built for the Story Protocol hackathon, demonstrating the full potential of programmable IP licensing infrastructure. The implementation showcases advanced integration with Story Protocol SDK, including derivative work tracking, automated royalty distribution, and agent-native design patterns.

## Social Impact

CreatorBridge democratizes IP protection and monetization:

- **Accessibility**: IP rights for creators who can't afford lawyers
- **Transparency**: On-chain provenance eliminates attribution disputes
- **Fair Compensation**: Automated royalties ensure creators benefit from downstream use
- **Cultural Preservation**: Immutable record of creative lineage and influence
- **Economic Empowerment**: New passive income streams from derivative works
